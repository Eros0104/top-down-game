## :computer: Prerequisites

Before starting, you will have to install the following tools:

- C++ Compiler, such as [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
- [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.26.5) and [SLD2 Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/) installed in the compiler
- Besides it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## :game_die: Getting started

```bash
# access the project directory

cd Jogo

# compile the project

./build.bat

# run the game.exe

./run.bat

```

## :wrench: Setup the project using MinGW

1. Install MinGW as the following document explains: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

2. Install SDL in MinGW: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/web/common/help/cpp_mingw-sdl-setup.php

3. Install SDL Image in MinGW (The process is the same to the SDL installation)
